            <div class="p2"><p><mark>Son Gohan (孫そん悟ご飯はん Son Gohan) is a half-breed Saiyan and one of the most prominent characters in the Dragon Ball series. He is the elder son of the series' primary protagonist Goku and his wife Chi-Chi, the older brother of Goten, the husband of Videl and father to Pan. He is named after Goku's adoptive grandfather, Gohan.
            Unlike his father, Gohan is a brilliant scholar and lacks a passion for fighting, preferring to do so only when his loved ones are threatened. Nevertheless, he spends much of his life participating in the defense of Earth, often helping to turn the tides when the dormant depths of his power are unleashed.</mark></p></div>
